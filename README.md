# CSE220-BRACU-LAB

<p>CSE220 covers the design, analysis, and implementation of data structures to solve engineering problems. Topics include elementary data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues and advanced data structures such as trees and graphs,and the algorithms used to manipulate these structures such as various sorting and searching algorithms and their application to solving practical engineering problems and performance analaysis by determining computational complexity.</p>

<i>Technical Requirements: array manipulation, loops, conditional logic, classes and objects.</i>
